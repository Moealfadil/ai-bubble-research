  - Earnings (EPS, surprises, estimates)
  - Balance Sheet (assets, liabilities, equity, cash)
  - Cash Flow (operating cash flow, capital expenditures, buybacks)
- **Market Cap Integration**: Loads quarter-matched market cap data from existing datasets
- **Automatic Resume**: Skips already processed companies, continues from where it left off
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and missing data

**Data Output**: Creates individual CSV files for each company with calculated financial metrics

### 2. `scripts/collect_complete_improved.py` - Enhanced Data Collection

**Purpose**: Alternative data collection script with improved market cap matching

**Features**:
- Enhanced market cap data integration
- Improved quarter matching algorithms
- Better handling of international tickers

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd ai-bubble-research/Data_collection/indicators
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Set Up API Keys

1. **Get Alpha Vantage API Keys**:
   - Visit [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
   - Sign up for free (25 calls/day per key)
   - Get multiple keys for higher daily capacity

2. **Create Environment File**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Add Your API Keys**:
   Edit `.env` file and add your keys:
   ```bash
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEYS=your_key_1,your_key_2,your_key_3,your_key_4
   ```

4. **Optional Configuration**:
   You can also customize other settings in `.env`:
   ```bash
   START_YEAR=2015
   END_YEAR=2025
   RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=15
   ```

### Step 3: Run Financial Data Collection

```bash
python scripts/alphadata.py
```

This will:
- Process all 160 companies from the merged tickers list
- Fetch quarterly financial data from 2015-2025
- Calculate comprehensive financial metrics
- Save individual CSV files for each company
- Handle API rate limits automatically
- Resume from where it left off if interrupted

### Step 4: Review Collected Data

After completion, you'll have:
- **160 individual company files** in `alpha/` directory
- **Quarterly financial data** spanning 2015-2025 or from the time the company was listed
- **Calculated metrics** including growth rates, ratios, and valuations
- **Market cap integration** for accurate P/E and P/S calculations

## Data Sources

- **Primary**: Alpha Vantage API (financial statements)
- **Secondary**: Existing market cap datasets in `complete_data_improved/`
- **Coverage**: 160 AI-related companies from GlobalX AIQ ETF holdings
- **Timeframe**: Quarterly data from 2015-2025

## Research Applications

This financial data collection supports research into:

1. **AI Bubble Analysis**: Identifying overvalued companies through fundamental analysis
2. **Revenue Validation**: Distinguishing real businesses from hype through revenue metrics
3. **Growth Pattern Analysis**: Understanding sustainable vs unsustainable growth
4. **Cash Flow Analysis**: Identifying companies burning cash vs generating cash
5. **R&D Investment Analysis**: Understanding innovation spending patterns
6. **Valuation Metrics**: P/E and P/S ratio analysis across AI companies

## API Management

The script includes sophisticated API management:
- **Multiple API Keys**: Rotates automatically when limits reached
- **Rate Limiting**: 15-second delays between calls
- **Daily Limits**: 25 calls per key per day (free tier)
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows API usage statistics
- **Automatic Pause**: Stops when all keys exhausted, resumes next day

## Output File Format

Each company file (`TICKER_alpha_data.csv`) contains:
- **ticker**: Company symbol
- **fiscalDateEnding**: Quarter end date
- **Financial Data**: Revenue, profit, cash flow, balance sheet items
- **Calculated Metrics**: Growth rates, ratios, margins
- **Market Cap**: Quarter-matched valuation data

## Security Notes

- **API Keys**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- **Environment Variables**: The `.env` file is automatically ignored by git
- **Key Rotation**: Use multiple API keys to distribute load and avoid limits
- **Free Tier**: Each key allows 25 calls/day, so 4 keys = 100 calls/day capacity

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- **Missing Keys**: Ensure `.env` file exists and contains `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEYS`
- **Invalid Keys**: Check that keys are valid and not expired
- **Format**: Keys should be comma-separated without spaces: `key1,key2,key3`

### API Rate Limiting
- Script automatically handles rate limits
- Shows progress and remaining capacity
- Pauses when all keys exhausted, resumes next day

### Missing Data
- Some companies may have limited financial history
- International companies may have different reporting standards
- Script saves partial data when available

### File Management
- Creates backup files before overwriting
- Skips already processed companies
- Maintains progress across multiple runs
