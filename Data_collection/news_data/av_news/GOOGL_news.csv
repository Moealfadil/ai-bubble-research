GOOGL,The 10 most innovative companies of 2022 reflecting current events,https://www.fastcompany.com/90724381/most-innovative-companies-current-events-2022,20220308T110041,Fast Company,"Anytime an organization earns recognition for truly groundbreaking work, it's news. But the 10 companies honored here, in a brand-new MIC category called ""Current Events,"" have been focused on innovating in areas that are already generating global headlines: COVID-19, the climate crisis, sustainability, social justice, mental health, economic inequality, and yes, of course, crypto. Watershed software enables businesses to assess their carbon footprint and create a plan to reduce emissions, while Edgybees is helping firefighters combat infernos with more accurate geolocation data. Pfizer developed its Paxlovid treatment in just eight months and secured FDA emergency-use authorization just in time for the omicron variant; Vivian transformed itself from a job-placement platform for traveling nurses into a broader job portal for healthcare workers burned out after two years of pandemic service. Sorenson Communications is enhancing telecommunications equipment to improve work-from-home options for the deaf, and DotCom Therapy is working with 400 schools and healthcare systems across 38 states to provide various forms of teletherapy to a demographic hit particularly hard by the psychological challenges of the last two years: school-age children. Color of Change is effectively pressuring companies and organizations to live up to public promises made in response to Black Lives Matter protests, focusing on the entertainment and fashion industries in partnership with such A-list creatives as Michael B. Jordan and Joan Smalls. Anchorage Digital became the first crypto management company to earn a federal charter as a bank, Hope Enterprise Corporation is creating new ways to expand lending to formerly credit-invisible citizens of the Deep South, and the headline-worthy-named startup F*** You Pay Me has invented a platform that provides influencers, an increasingly powerful economic force, greater detail about the deals their peers are securing. Here are this year's 10 honorees in the Current Events category of Most Innovative Companies. For helping Airbnb, Shopify, and other companies chart a path to net-zero emissions Watershed helps companies, such as Shopify, Stripe, and Sweetgreen, decarbonize their businesses, from their direct operations to their entire supply chain. Its software analyzes a company's carbon emissions to build a climate-impact plan; such as Square's December 2020 announcement of its net-zero target by 2030, including efforts to transition Bitcoin mining to renewable energy sources. Watershed's data is instrumental in helping customers go to their biggest suppliers to pressure them to clean up their emissions. It also has created a marketplace where its customers can buy clean power and invest in carbon-removal projects-with Watershed's software guiding companies to the solutions that will help them reach their goals. The startup, which hatched in 2019, only officially launched in February 2021, attracting additional high-profile customers, such as Airbnb, Expensify, and Vimeo. By the end of Watershed's first year, it was helping customers manage emissions equivalent to more than four times the carbon footprint of San Francisco, the site of Watershed's headquarters.",0.175386,Somewhat-Bullish,,,0,focused,AI
GOOGL,The 10 most innovative companies in the workplace in 2022,https://www.fastcompany.com/90724501/most-innovative-companies-workplace-2022,20220308T110029,Fast Company,"The workplace became a fraught battleground in the second year of the pandemic, with employees seeing opportunities to rethink what they want out of work and participating in the Great Resignation, as it became known, and employers often engaging in tentative efforts to define a new normal while COVID-19 and its variants wreaked havoc with even the best-laid plans. Within this charged environment, we sought to identify the companies that were either providing the kind of tools that were designed to create a thriving, positive environment regardless of whether work was in-person, hybrid, or fully remote, or that inherently understood the nature of this tumult and adapted its policies and approach to serve employees. On top of those trends, we are always on the lookout for the forefront in benefits and tools that enhance work. To these ends, our honorees for the most innovative workplace companies this year include Miro, whose virtual whiteboard service expanded to meet the growing needs of enterprises to host large-scale meetings and guide even the smallest kickoff gathering to ultimate success. Dialpad, Atlassian, Slack, and Hopin all made meaningful strides in furthering digital communication that can adapt to a variety of workplace scenarios. Lyla's concierge service supports employees who needed help balancing work and life when it's all taking place in the same room, particularly mental-health resources, and Carrot Fertility offered the employees of forward-thinking companies a wider and more enlightened array of family-planning benefits. Dropbox modified its offices and its schedule to accommodate the realities of being a virtual-first company, 15Five bolstered its tools to help its thousands of clients foster better managers, because a bad manager is the number-one reason employees choose to leave. And when all else fails, the job-search giant Indeed is there, with streamlined features to accelerate applying and interviewing for a job.",0.148831,Neutral,,,0,focused,"AI, ML"

It was May 2012, and the Australians, both in their mid-twenties, had flown from Sydney to Silicon Valley six months earlier to raise money from investors on Sand Hill Road. The couple had met as teens at the University of Western Australia in Perth. Neither had formally studied the discipline of design  ( Perkins had majored in communications, Obrecht in education ) , but Perkins had tutored other students in Photoshop in her spare time and had become fascinated by tools that made design more accessible to, well, self-described Luddites like Obrecht. Together, they had launched Fusion Books, an online yearbook-design product that was chugging along back home. They'd come to California with a simple pitch: They needed funds to build a platform that would allow anyone to design just about anything, all within a single interface. Instead, they received more than 100 rejections. That afternoon, the final name on their once-promising spreadsheet of VCs had turned red. So, the usually optimistic pair went on a ""misery walk,"" recalls Obrecht, to decide if they had run out of options. After three hours of soul-searching, they determined they hadn't. ""We got up the next morning and just started back at it,"" he says. Within a few months, they raised the first part of what would become a $3 million seed round. A year later, they launched the online design and publishing tool, Canva.",0.124318,Neutral,,,0,focused,AI
