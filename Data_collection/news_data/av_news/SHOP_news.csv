Watershed software enables businesses to assess their carbon footprint and create a plan to reduce emissions, while Edgybees is helping firefighters combat infernos with more accurate geolocation data. Pfizer developed its Paxlovid treatment in just eight months and secured FDA emergency-use authorization just in time for the omicron variant; Vivian transformed itself from a job-placement platform for traveling nurses into a broader job portal for healthcare workers burned out after two years of pandemic service. Sorenson Communications is enhancing telecommunications equipment to improve work-from-home options for the deaf, and DotCom Therapy is working with 400 schools and healthcare systems across 38 states to provide various forms of teletherapy to a demographic hit particularly hard by the psychological challenges of the last two years: school-age children. Color of Change is effectively pressuring companies and organizations to live up to public promises made in response to Black Lives Matter protests, focusing on the entertainment and fashion industries in partnership with such A-list creatives as Michael B. Jordan and Joan Smalls. Anchorage Digital became the first crypto management company to earn a federal charter as a bank, Hope Enterprise Corporation is creating new ways to expand lending to formerly credit-invisible citizens of the Deep South, and the headline-worthy-named startup F*** You Pay Me has invented a platform that provides influencers, an increasingly powerful economic force, greater detail about the deals their peers are securing. Here are this year's 10 honorees in the Current Events category of Most Innovative Companies. For helping Airbnb, Shopify, and other companies chart a path to net-zero emissions Watershed helps companies, such as Shopify, Stripe, and Sweetgreen, decarbonize their businesses, from their direct operations to their entire supply chain. Its software analyzes a company's carbon emissions to build a climate-impact plan; such as Square's December 2020 announcement of its net-zero target by 2030, including efforts to transition Bitcoin mining to renewable energy sources. Watershed's data is instrumental in helping customers go to their biggest suppliers to pressure them to clean up their emissions. It also has created a marketplace where its customers can buy clean power and invest in carbon-removal projects-with Watershed's software guiding companies to the solutions that will help them reach their goals. The startup, which hatched in 2019, only officially launched in February 2021, attracting additional high-profile customers, such as Airbnb, Expensify, and Vimeo. By the end of Watershed's first year, it was helping customers manage emissions equivalent to more than four times the carbon footprint of San Francisco, the site of Watershed's headquarters.",0.175386,Somewhat-Bullish,0.034378,Bullish,0,focused,AI

From features aimed at generating and managing creators' revenue streams to merchants expanding their businesses through social channels, companies found new ways to meet the increasing demands of a growing class of entrepreneurs. And what would 2021 be on social media without diving into non-fungible tokens  ( NFTs )  and the metaverse? Though still in its nascency in the mainstream, Web3 has no intention of fizzling out anytime soon, which has given rise to startups looking to help creators leverage the burgeoning space. Leading the Most Innovative Companies in social media is Shopify. The e-commerce platform made major expansions in powering businesses on social media by bringing in-app shopping to TikTok, adding 27 markets in Pinterest, and expanding its Shop Pay feature to Facebook and Instagram. Shopify also made a play in music streaming by enabling artists to add online stores to their Spotify pages. Covering a different sector of social commerce is Ooooo, which aims to bring the fervor and massive revenue of live commerce in China to the West. In addition to its own live commerce app, Ooooo white labels its technology with partners including QVC Italia and Brazilian online retailer B2W. Major platforms such as TikTok and Instagram laid the foundation for the booming creator economy, and now there's a race to help creators monetize and organize their businesses and brands. Koji earned a spot on this year's Most Innovative Companies list as a compelling addition to the link-in-bio services that have become an essential part of a creator's toolkit. Koji's standout features include selling ad space on a profile, paid video requests à la Cameo, and other monetizing features.",0.123846,Neutral,0.143281,Neutral,0,focused,AI
