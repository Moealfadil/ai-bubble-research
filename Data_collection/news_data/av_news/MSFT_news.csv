Within this charged environment, we sought to identify the companies that were either providing the kind of tools that were designed to create a thriving, positive environment regardless of whether work was in-person, hybrid, or fully remote, or that inherently understood the nature of this tumult and adapted its policies and approach to serve employees. On top of those trends, we are always on the lookout for the forefront in benefits and tools that enhance work. To these ends, our honorees for the most innovative workplace companies this year include Miro, whose virtual whiteboard service expanded to meet the growing needs of enterprises to host large-scale meetings and guide even the smallest kickoff gathering to ultimate success. Dialpad, Atlassian, Slack, and Hopin all made meaningful strides in furthering digital communication that can adapt to a variety of workplace scenarios. Lyla's concierge service supports employees who needed help balancing work and life when it's all taking place in the same room, particularly mental-health resources, and Carrot Fertility offered the employees of forward-thinking companies a wider and more enlightened array of family-planning benefits.

For years, Baird, a former community organizer, had been pitching venture capitalists on his vision to electrify buildings by installing technologies like heat pumps and solar panels. BlocPower would play a dual role, acting as an implementation partner for local governments and utilities sponsoring decarbonization initiatives, and as a lender and project manager for homeowners and landlords looking to eliminate emissions through electrification. Though Baird had raised more than $20 million in venture funding from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Kapor Capital, he'd also met ample skeptics along the way. How could BlocPower turn every home into the equivalent of a Tesla, some investors asked, when Baird was determined to focus on buildings in low- and middle-income communities? In New York City, Baird had demonstrated the viability of his plan through retrofits to more than 800 multifamily apartment buildings, 250 single-family homes, and more than 100 houses of worship and small businesses. Now he had a chance to make good on the full scope of his vision. Earlier in the year, city leaders in Ithaca had approved an ambitious plan to become carbon-neutral by 2030, and they had selected BlocPower to help them implement energy-efficiency retrofits and replace existing heating and cooling systems with heat pumps. The first phase of the city's plans called for BlocPower to decarbonize and electrify 1,600 buildings, including 1,000 homes. To do so, though, the startup would have to win over local residents, who would be eligible through BlocPower for equipment leases or low-interest loans designed, with the help of government incentives, to make installing and leasing climate-friendly home technologies affordable to all. Baird had a long list of people to meet and neighborhoods to visit from across Ithaca, a progressive university city with a poverty rate approaching 40%.",0.025857,Neutral,0.021523,Neutral,0,focused,AI

It was May 2012, and the Australians, both in their mid-twenties, had flown from Sydney to Silicon Valley six months earlier to raise money from investors on Sand Hill Road. The couple had met as teens at the University of Western Australia in Perth. Neither had formally studied the discipline of design  ( Perkins had majored in communications, Obrecht in education ) , but Perkins had tutored other students in Photoshop in her spare time and had become fascinated by tools that made design more accessible to, well, self-described Luddites like Obrecht. Together, they had launched Fusion Books, an online yearbook-design product that was chugging along back home. They'd come to California with a simple pitch: They needed funds to build a platform that would allow anyone to design just about anything, all within a single interface. Instead, they received more than 100 rejections. That afternoon, the final name on their once-promising spreadsheet of VCs had turned red. So, the usually optimistic pair went on a ""misery walk,"" recalls Obrecht, to decide if they had run out of options. After three hours of soul-searching, they determined they hadn't. ""We got up the next morning and just started back at it,"" he says. Within a few months, they raised the first part of what would become a $3 million seed round.
