In a professional setting, learning whom to trust can be particularly challenging given its potential economic and career impact. That's especially true today. As hierarchal organizations give way to more autonomous ways of working, trust is critical. Fewer in-person experiences also can make it harder to read between the lines. In his book The Speed of Trust, Stephen M.R. Covey describes it this way: ""Trust is a function of two things: character and competence. Character includes your integrity, your motive, your intent with people. Competence includes your capabilities, your skills, your results, your track record. And both are vital."" I'd add a third component: consistency. Trust is reinforced or undermined based on past behavior. It's an important frame of reference. Together, character, competence, and consistency represent the essential elements of trust.",0.044272,Neutral,0.038549,Neutral,0,focused,autonomous
